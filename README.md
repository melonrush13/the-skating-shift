## Dev Environment

### Development Container

Dev Containers allows users to run their development environment inside of a Docker container while using Visual Studio code. A dev container is helpful because we don't have to worry about having different versions of Python installed on our machine. Instead, we can specify what versions of everything to run inside of our Docker container and focus on our code. This is possible because of the Remote Containers VS Code Extension provided by Microsoft.
